# Clicking Game

# Description
A simple clicking web game where you click a button to get a high score within 30 seconds.
I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

# How to play
- Click the green "Click Me!" button
- The score will increase with each click, and the button moves randomly
- The game ends when the timer reaches 0

# Motivation
I made this because I like creating games and I want to make a simple but fun game.

# Chanllenges and Learning
I learned how to make a simple game of my interest.
I struggled with the format of the game.
